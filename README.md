# Double Descent Testbed

## Getting Started

The Double Descent Testbed is an open-source platform to conduct experiments related to the [double descent phenomenon](https://openai.com/blog/deep-double-descent/). Read the full blog post here:

### Before you start

You should have [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) installed. This is the package manager we will use to install all of the dependencies.

Once Anaconda is installed, install [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) (along with torchvision). If you have access to an Nvidia GPU, make sure to install PyTorch with CUDA support. GPU acceleration will *greatly* reduce the amount of time to conduct experiments. You will also need to install [NumPy](https://numpy.org/install/), [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html), [TensorBoard](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/tensorboardand), and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/installing/index.html)
